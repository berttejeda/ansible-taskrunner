# Vagrant Command Example

The Taskfile here consists of an ansible playbook that has been repurposed as a bastardized bash script.

We've also made it into a meta-automation step to the `vagrant` command.

Essentially, this is a:
- Stripped down ansible playbook that holds bash functions represented in YAML syntax
- Embedded functions are meant to facilitate interaction with the vagrant command, e.g. providing some custom cli options and the like

## Install and Obtain Project Files

* `pip install ansible-taskrunner` OR<br />
* `pip install git+https://github.com/berttejeda/ansible-taskrunner.git` OR<br />
* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/berttejeda/ansible-taskrunner/releases)<br />
* Clone the git repository and navigate to the example<br />

```
git clone https://github.com/berttejeda/ansible-taskrunner.git
cd ansible-taskrunner/exercises/bash
```

## Display Usage

`tasks run --help`

```
Essentially, this is a:
- Stripped down ansible playbook that holds bash functions represented in YAML
syntax
- Embedded functions are meant to facilitate interaction with the vagrant
command, e.g. providing some custom cli options and the like

Options:
  --version             Show the version and exit.
  ---make, ---m TEXT    Call shell function
  ---raw TEXT           Specify raw options for underlying subprocess
  ---echo               Don't run, simply echo underlying commands
  --oel76               Invoke the 'vagrant_up_oel76' shell function
  --xenial              Invoke the 'vagrant_up_xenial' shell function
  ---vagrant-test-flag  Set the _vagrant_test_flag value to true
  --help                Show this message and exit.


None
Examples:
- You want to fire up an Ubuntu Xenial x64 machine:
tasks run --xenial
- You want to fire up an Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.6 x64 machine:
tasks run --oel76

Available shell functions:
vagrant_up_oel76: Bring up an Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.6 x64 Virtual Machine
vagrant_up_xenial: Bring up an Ubuntu Xenial x64 Virtual Machine

```
tasks run --xenial
```

# Learning Points

- You are able to easily adjust cli options for your YAML-organized Bash script :)
- You are able to seamlessly interact with the vagrant command
- You can get pretty creative with how you proceed with this approach
- This is how I'm managing my vagrant environments at the moment
	- See: ## TODO: Share your vagrant setup

<a name="caveats"></a>
# Caveats

- Consider this **experimental**, as I have not had extensive experience vetting the possible *gotchas* with this configuration (i.e. calling the `vagrant` command via python **subprocess**)
- As with any piece of automation, you can do some serious damage given the right set of commands and functions.
- Please, for the love of FSM, make sure you know what you're doing ðŸ˜Ž
