# Vagrant Command Example

The Tasksfile here consists of an ansible playbook that has been repurposed as a bastardized bash script.

We've also made it into a meta-automation step to the `vagrant` command.

Essentially, this is a:
- Stripped down ansible playbook that holds bash functions represented in YAML syntax
- Embedded functions are meant to facilitate interaction with the vagrant command, e.g. providing some custom cli options and the like

# Learning Points

- You are able to easily adjust cli options for your YAML-organized Bash script :)
- You are able to seamlessly interact with the vagrant command
- You can get pretty creative with how you proceed with this approach
- This is how I'm managing my vagrant environments at the moment
	- See: 

<a name="caveats"></a>
# Caveats

- Consider this **experimental**, as I have not had extensive experience vetting the possible *gotchas* with this configuration (i.e. calling the `vagrant` command via python **subprocess**)
- As with any piece of automation, you can do some serious damage given the right set of commands and functions.
- Please, for the love of FSM, make sure you know what you're doing ðŸ˜Ž
