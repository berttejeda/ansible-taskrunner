# Custom CLI Provider Example

**Note**: This exercise only works with python 3 (for now)
**TODO**: Refactor plugin logic to work with python version 2.x

Here we employ a custom cli-provider named _example_

The cli-provider is located in the [plugins](plugins) directory adjacent to this document.

The Tasksfile here consists of an ansible playbook that has been repurposed as a bastardized bash script.

Essentially, it's a stripped down ansible playbook that holds bash functions represented in YAML syntax.

The exercise here showcases how one can extend the functionality of `tasks`, the ansible task runner command
through the use of custom cli-provider plugins.

# Exercises

<a name="obtain-project-files"></a>
## Obtain Project Files

* Download the latest [release](https://github.com/berttejeda/ansible-taskrunner/releases)<br />
* Clone the git repository and navigate to the example<br />

```
git clone https://github.com/berttejeda/ansible-taskrunner.git
cd ansible-taskrunner/exercises/custom-cli-provider
```
<a name="show-help-message"></a>
## Show help message

* Let's review the output of the the `run` subcommand help<br />
```
tasks run --help
```

You should see `--this-is-an-example-switch` in the option listing.

You can get creative by adjusting the `invocation` function in the [example](plugins/providers/example) plugin.

It's all python, so code away to your heart's content!

# Learning Points

- You are able to easily adjust cli options for your YAML-organized Bash script :)
- You are able to override the default handler for command and cli-options through a plugin system
- You can get pretty creative with how you proceed with this approach

<a name="caveats"></a>
# Caveats

- Again, the plugin system is only working for python 3, so don't expect this to work if your python version is 2.x.
- As with any piece of automation, you can do some serious damage given the right set of commands and functions.
- Please, for the love of FSM, make sure you know what you're doing ðŸ˜Ž
